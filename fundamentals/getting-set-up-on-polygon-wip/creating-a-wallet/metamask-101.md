# ðŸ¦Š Metamask 101

Used by [over 30 million traders](https://metamask.io/) globally, MetaMask is supported by multiple device types. This includes an app for iOS and Android, as well as a web browser extension. The latter supports Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox.

It takes just seconds to download and install MetaMask onto the chosen device. This is a non-custodial wallet, meaning users control their private keys. MetaMask displays private keys in an easy-to-view format via a 12-word passphrase. Users will need to write this down when setting up the wallet.
