# üßë‚Äçüè´ What are NFTs?

You can consider NFTs like special digital collectibles.

You know how you collect baseball cards, stamps, or coins? Well, NFTs are like that, but for digital things, like art, music, videos, or even virtual items in video games.

The word "crypto" might sound a bit fancy, but it's just short for "cryptocurrency." Cryptocurrencies are like digital money, kind of like the money you use online when you play games on your tablet. But instead of dollars or euros transferred through banks, it's things like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or WAX, transferred on a blockchain.

The blockchain is like a digital ledger keeping a trackable history of all transactions made on it, keeping track of who owns what, and who may have permission on the chain to do different things.&#x20;

Now, here's where it gets interesting. NFTs and crypto work together sometimes. For example, if you want to buy a digital painting as an NFT, you usually use cryptocurrencies to pay for it. Or perhaps you might be trading one bundle of NFTs for other NFTs in agreed upon on-chain secured trades.

People love NFTs because they're unique. When you have a digital collectible as an NFT, it's like having the only one in the whole world! It's different from just saving a picture on your computer because NFTs use something called "blockchain" to make sure everyone knows who owns what.

Think of the blockchain as a big, super-secure list that shows who owns what NFT. It's like a really fancy way of saying, "I have the real one."

People also like NFTs because they can be worth a lot of money. If someone wants your special digital collectible, they might pay a lot for it! Just like how some baseball cards are super rare and valuable.

And last, but not least, because an NFT usually does not 'tare from the passage of time'. NFTs are digital on-chain, and could potentially last in perfect shape there, **forever**! Although this can of course never be guaranteed..

So, in a nutshell, NFTs are like one-of-a-kind digital treasures, and cryptocurrencies are the digital money you use to buy them. It's all about owning and trading cool, digital stuff on the internet. Cool, right? üòÑ
