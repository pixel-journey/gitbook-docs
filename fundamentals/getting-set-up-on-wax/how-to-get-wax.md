# ðŸ’± How to get Wax

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure to know there's a difference between WAXP, WAXE and which blockchains/account types each are sent or received by! WAXP is the token used by the Wax Blockchain itself. Whereas WAXE is the Ethereum ERC-20 token for the part of Wax DeFI happening and originating from there.



WAXP is sent to Wax Accounts. WAXE to Ethereum Accounts. You can bridge from WAXP to WAXE and Visa-versa via the [CloudWallet](creating-a-wallet/cloudwallet-101.md) token bridges
{% endhint %}

Our main recommended route to acquire Wax is by market orders from exchanges listing Wax (a list can be found here via the [Wax page of coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wax/): [Exchanges listing Wax](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wax/markets))

If you're experiencing issues finding exchanges that will allow your location (for example coming from the US, or another country not supported by Binance or KuCoin), an another alternative option can be using [SimpleSwap.io](https://simpleswap.io/):

From SimpleSwap you can easily Swap most common cryptocurrencies into Wax, only requiring a destination Wax-wallet to have the swap results deposited to. (No KYC, no account creation needed, low \~1-2% swap fees)

In comparison the Market/Swap tools on Binance (Binance Convert/Trade), might offer slightly lower swap fees, less slippage(/more liquidity), and can result in slightly better results. However it might not make a big difference for 'lower' trade amounts.



On Alcor Exchange you can also find a Simpleswap.io integration on their "buy crypto" section, which similarly easily allows you to buy crypto swapping in a few steps by selecting the token you want to swap, asking you where the bought WAXP tokens should be sent, and giving you a deposit address to send your tokens to be exchanged.

A third option is buying WAXE on your preferred Ethereum Exchange (for example uniswap), and bridging that WAXE to WAXP via the Cloud Wallet. You can find a guide for that here on Medium:

[How to Buy WAXP using Metamask](https://medium.com/@di0nix/how-to-buy-waxp-using-paypal-or-a-credit-card-203db0dac585)

Or via EOS tokens, which is explained in the guide by dionix here:
