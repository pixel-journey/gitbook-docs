# üèõÔ∏è For Projects

{% hint style="info" %}
**Get in contact:** Join our Discord and create a ticket to get in direct contact with our team.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

We hope to be able to collaborate with as many projects we can reach and make sense to incorporate along our Pixel Journey, and if your project could be interested in that too, then let me tell you what we could do for you:

* Incorporating your project/dApp into our journey (contact for more details)
* Cross-community/project events (promotional, educational or just for fun)
* Future trait reference incorporations (as each season will have their PFPs/themes, each season will require new traits as well)
* Cross-collection blends/NFT crafts
* Token/NFT distribution of your assets via our NFT-reward pool/mechanics (and visa-versa)
* Project advising, guidance and (community-backed/reviewed) feedback
* Help sharing your projects to new/the right audiences
* Help finding you new collectors, or new creators to collaborate with
