# ðŸ¤´ For Partners

Along the seasons and the overall journey we'll have a series opportunities to collaborate with various other artists, builders, projects and business'.

We will run a few different 'aspects/levels' of collaborations and partnerships:

* event/giveaway partnerships _(can be short/long period events, with prizes and promotions from both parties project-economies)_
* art/branding partnerships _(with some of your art incorporated into our project .. or visa-versa)_
* mechanics/utility partnerships _(where 'utility' is given to either parties project mechanics, in the opposite project)_
* education/promotion partnerships _(mainly focused on teaching each side of the partners' community more about what the other project is about)_



### What can the Pixel Journey do for you?

We're highly flexible, and might be able to incorporate you into our project in multiple ways. We can offer to:

* Advice and support your project (both on private team-to-team basis, and with wider community reviews)
* Introduce your content to our community
  * Cover your project in our ecosystem onboarding explanations, recommendations and guides
  * Introduce your art/game/mechanics to our community on Discord
  * Keep our Discord community updated with partner-project news
  * Share your project/content to our wider audiences via Twitter
* Incorporate your content to our Pixel-collection (as well as our pixel-economy and blending mechanics, with optional opportunities for cross-collection blends or physical redeemable end-results)
* Add your links here among our Ecosystem Partners, on our website and other Social Network platforms.
* Ensure you to be referred to/figure in future seasons PFP traits.
* We might be able to help onboard users to your preferred networks or ecosystems too.

### What we look for?

In our partners we hope to find&#x20;

* great artists of every type - that we can help potentially reach new collectors, help getting started with NFTs in different ecosystems, or ways for incorporating into our Pixel Journey collection
* trusted parties that can be relied on to uphold the collab/partnership agreements made
* projects that share the same values and goals as we do
* projects building a better web3 for the world of tomorrow
* active communities that are looking for new things to explore and learn
* dApps and games from across the metaverse that can be fun for our community to pursuit together
* knowledge, opportunities and fun to offer our community along the way
* new neat/useful rewards & prizes to share with our community
