description: Every project should have goals. And so, of course, does the Pixel Journey!
---

# üèÜ What is the goal here?

* To create a community where everybody can have fun!
* To meet new friends along this shared journey of ours
* To collectively learn and discover new amazing things (with the proper, safe, DYOR!)
* To offer a safe, helpful, guided onboarding experience into NFTs and crypto
* To showcase the amazing (free?) features across each of our journeys, blockchains and ecosystems!
* To further help connecting all of Wax, with the wider Web3 space and beyond
* Collaborating to make Pixels and JPEGs all around greater than ever before!
* To offer projects/artists a new way to reach new audiences (our community) by becoming incorporated into our Pixel Journey, its collection (in various pixelated shapes/themes), and in our Pixel-economy
* For collectors to find new neat and epic things to collect!
* To present a project design that hopefully prove to be sustainable, well-balanced, stable and to stand the test of time .. ? And hopefully show more projects/early founders new ideas and ways to build their projects as well üèõÔ∏è
