# ðŸª™ Kickstarting the PXJ-Economy

Our $PXJ token will be used along the whole Pixel Journey as our main token.\
\
We'll "ICO" it along our first season here on Wax, and it'll play a most central part all along the way. \
\
The total supply of it is planned to be 10 billion, with approximately 10% of the undistributed supply being distributed each season. \
This means we'll distribute 1 billion during the first season, 900 mil during the second, 810 mil during the third and so on. Leading to a built in 'halvening' in token distribution output after out 6th season.

The allocation of the tokens per season will vary a bit, but for the first season we'll have approximately:&#x20;

* \~ 10% distributed via burnable NFTs with different amount chances (these will be partly given away in events/random rewards, and partly for sale for Wax/the token itself, as seen on the image below)&#x20;
* \~ 20% will be distributed via our SALSA/MEAL Pools and Alcor Farm Rewards
* \~ 15-25% will be allocated the initial LP-pools, added there on behalf of the team/project itself, along with a certain % of our sales earnings
* \~ 20% will be be made available for the WaxRocks council to vote how to spend (perhaps boosting something else? or for airdropping random traits?)&#x20;
* \~ 20% will be distributed via WaxDAO to select of our crafted collectibles
* \~ \~ 5% for other collections assets as promo/partnership agreements

_(these are % of the seasonal allocation of 1 bil, not of the total supply)_

Apart from being useful for staking in the TacoSwap pools in itself, or for directly selling into our LPs, then the token will also be used in certain future drops/sales for special crafting ingredients (aside the single pixel NFTs from the packs after burning NFTs), [limited collectible drops](../recycling-and-crafting/pixel-collectibles.md) or possibly upgrades to other collectibles in the collection.\
\
I also hope to eventually incorporate the token into the PixelDAO aspect of the project (in later seasons, for season1 the [WaxRocks](../the-waxrocks-council.md) will mainly rule the initial 'DAO' aspects).
