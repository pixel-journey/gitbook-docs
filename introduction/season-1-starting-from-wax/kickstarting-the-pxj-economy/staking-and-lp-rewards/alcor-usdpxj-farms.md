From the Alcor Farms list you can find our Farms for the $PXJ pair which will include $PXJ and $WAXP, but potentially also many other Wax ecosytem tokens.

For our initial Alcor Farms we've added in 10 million TOC over a year to show off the concept here, and there'll also soon be added PXJ rewards:

* Manage Alcor LP position from [https://alcor.exchange/positions](https://alcor.exchange/positions)
* When opening a PXJ/WAX position make sure to pick Fee type: 1% (the other pools are not yet setup)
* Your position needs to be actively 'staked' to Alcor Farms from the [https://alcor.exchange/farm](https://alcor.exchange/farm) site before you start generating farming rewards! Click the "stake" button if you see the red "Not Staked" message on the token list
