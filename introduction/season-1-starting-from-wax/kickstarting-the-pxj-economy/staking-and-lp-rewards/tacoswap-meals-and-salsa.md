# TacoSwap (MEALS & SALSA)



[https://swap.tacocrypto.io/salsa?search=pxj](https://swap.tacocrypto.io/salsa?search=pxj)If you're all new to TacoSwap and their MEALS/SALSA pools, consider checking this [article from their medium introducing it](https://medium.com/@taco.wax/taco-swap-18aa7624af7).

Otherwise, in quick summary here:

The Taco Project on Wax offers a series of staking reward tools on their TacoSwap site, which offers great LP-provider reward possibilities that we plan to introduce to the Pixel Journey here in Season 1.

They have two different types:

* Single staking rewards: SALSA pools
* Token pair LP rewards: MEALS pools

Using these two options projects can setup/create reward programs/periods where they distribute stakers of their project tokens. Rewards can be both tokens (e.g. $WAXP, $PXJ or the platforms own $TACO token), or NFT rewards.

These rewards become available claimable daily to stakers, and can have a widely varying APY % value, depending on a ton of different factors such as amount of liquidity locked (TVL), volume (as LP provider fees can add up significantly), and number of users participating in each pool/reward option made available.
