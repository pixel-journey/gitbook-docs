# ♻️ Recycling & Crafting

A mechanic we'll start out utilizing quite a lot will be "recycling" (or blending) of NFTs. Most/all of our assets will be reusable, or upgradable, into new things as we move along.\
The Pixal PFPs will primarily be the key to open up for the Pixel Journeys economy via their early near-exclusive access to PixelPacks here for Season 1. Our $PXJ token will similarly be a core resource needed at every step of the recycling/crafting routes of our Pixel Journey.

The Pixal PFPs are recyclable(blendable) into Pixel Ingredient Pack NFTs, which will further be unpackable to claim the 10 Pixel Ingredients NFTs within.

Both the PixelPacks and these single ingredient pixels will be directly stakable for our $PXJ token via our WaxDao NFT Farm. They'll become upgradable to unlock higher/special pixel ingredient colors, and be a core ingredient for many of the craftables that will become available from the Wax Blockchain.

### What are Pixel Ingredient Packs?

Pixel Ingredient Packs are the next initial steps on the journey here towards Pixel Collectibles, that'll increasingly bind our whole pixel economy together as it becomes fully released step-by-step.

They each contain 10x Primary colored Pixel Ingredients (randomly red, blue, yellow), and these primary Pixel Ingredients will become combinable/blendable alongside a splash of PXJ into secondary Pixel Ingredients (green, purple, orange). Specific amounts of various colored Ingredients will be required for Pixel Journey 'collectible crafts/upgrades' to come, which you can read more about here in our docs: https://docs.pixeljourney.xyz/introduction/season-1-starting-from-wax/pixel-recycling-and-crafting/pixel-blends-and-upgrades

To begin with the Pixel Ingredient Packs are starting out exclusively acquired via Pixal PFP recycling in this blend. (After every \~1k recycled Pixals, we'll begin to add a few handful Pixel Ingredient Packs to our TacoSwap NFT Rewards, and run a few special Pixel Ingredient Pack giveaway/events as well. So there will eventually be alternative ways to obtain these Pixel Ingredient Packs, if you're extra extra lucky!)

### PXJ Recycling Fee Increase per 500 Pixals recycled

the Recycling PXJ Fee starts at 2000 PXJ per recycle, with an incremental PXJ cost of 2000 PXJ for every 500 Pixals that are recycled.

### **Warning! Recycles are BURNS and CANNOT be undone!**

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure to be careful with your selections when choosing your Pixal burn selections. WaxRock / PixelPet trait owning Pixals could for example be less ideal choices to start out recycling, NFA!
