  along our Pixel Journey

# Pixel Collectibles

Most of the collectibles further along in the journey will be obtainable in the following ways:

1. Via occasional random Pixal PFP Trait airdrop-rewards
2. Via TacoSwap NFT-staking rewards
3. Via events and giveaways on our servers/Twitters
4. Via blends/crafts made available along the way on NeftyBlocks blends and NFTHive crafts

Each collectible may end up having widely different crafting demands, as well as mint-availability, and will be announced via our channels well ahead of becoming unlockable.

Most of our most common crafts will be in a supply that is unlikely to run out, and may continue till their duration/seasons expire. In the other end more exclusive crafts along the way may end up selling out quickly, or having a small sale window of availability, so those interested collectors will need to be ready for, and quick to claim.

As an extra special feature among certain of our [Pixal PFP](../the-pixal-pfps/) (background) traits; Holders of certain traits will automatically have an added chance of occasionally getting pixelated photography (initially mainly from [Piga](../../the-pxjourney-team.md)) airdropped.

These pixelpromo/collectibles will be among the first of our upgradable NFTs, and you can read more about how that works [in this Next following section](pixel-blends-and-upgrades.md).
