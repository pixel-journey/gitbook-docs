# üèõÔ∏è The WaxRocks Council

The WaxRocks council will be the first/highest level to the planned community-governance mechanics, which we'll aim to build further out into a full PixelDAO as we progress and grow these aspects of the project along our Pixel Journey.

In the pre-season of the Pixel Journey the lv+10 community members could take part in community polls on various matters, and influence decisions for our shared journey.&#x20;

Now in this next/current phase, we'll move our Pixel Journey governance towards "5 levels" for now running in the following structure of:

1. Piga / Pixel Journey team - the top governance creating/managing the Pixel Governance till its autonomous
2. WaxRocks Council (including WaxPebbles) - our highest governance influence level
3. Pixel Journey holders (Pixal holders, whales, LP whales)
4. Higher ranked Pixel Journey community members
5. Public/common members

From the top here we'll in the team decide which votes/decisions to bring up in our community-votes and extended PixelDAO. Everybody is welcome to bring new matters/opportunities up as suggestions or for discussion in our Discord, and can influence future votes to come as well.





{% hint style="info" %}
Currently it's planned to give voting bonuses depending on Discord roles held. These are not final numbers, but could be looking something like the following..  (WIP) üëá
{% endhint %}

#### Base voting powers:

* Level Rank 5+ base voting power of 0.5 (minimum level required to unlock future 'open' votes)
* Level Rank 10+ base voting power of 1
* Level Rank 20+ base voting power of 2
* Level 42+ base voting power of 4
* Level 69+ base voting power of 8\
  ..
* Level 200+ base voting power of 32\
  ..
* Level 400+ base voting power of 56
* Level 500+ base voting power of 64

#### Voting boosts via special/ownership roles:

* WaxRocks boosts voting power weight by 64
* WaxRock Stackers (+3) boosts voting power weight by 140
* WaxRock Whale (+10) boosts voting power weight by 140
* WaxPebbles boosts voting power weight by 6
* Pixal Holders (+1) boosts voting power weight by 1
* Pixal Stackers (+50) boosts voting power weight by 5
* Pixal Whales (+100) boosts voting power weight by 25
* Pixal Krakens (+500 Pixals) boosts voting power weight by 50
* Pixal Completist (Full Trait collection, - WaxRocks) boosts voting power weight by 25
* PixelPet Completist (Full PixelPet collection) boost voting power weight by 1
* (10/10 -) 1/1 Collectible Holders boosts voting power weight by (10 -) 100
* PXJ Whales (???) boosts voting power weight by .. (TBD, we still don't have FT role tracking)
* Active community Artists/Devs/Writers/Moderator roles boosts voting power weight by 5

And similarly for roles made available in the future.&#x20;

These boosts are meant to be additive, so holders of multiple of the roles will be able to add together their boosts to their base voting power to determine their full voting power;

<mark style="background-color:blue;">Total Voting Power = Base Voting Power + Role Boost 1 ‚Äã + Role Boost 2 ‚Äã + .. + Role Boost n ‚Äã</mark>

Which would mean that with the initial voting boosts would be able to reach as high as 200-300 in voting power if dedicated enough to obtain all the vote boosting roles.



### WaxRocks:

With a total of \~400 WaxRocks planned for Season 1, we'll initially allow for 0.1% of our PFP minters to have the chance to mint a variant of the WaxRocks. These trait-holders will gain access to special parts of our Discord where they'll take part in deciding the paths we take, as well as other perks such as a 30% XP boost on the Discords leveling system.\
At a later phase of Season 1, the WaxRocks themselves will be airdropped to holders of the trait PFPs. \
\
With the **tiny** 0.1% chance to get the WaxRock traits, we estimate there should be a total of approximately 100 WaxRock traits among our 10k Pixal PFPs, which will leave \~300 up to be acquired in other ways.

* 25% via Pixal PFP WaxRock traits
* 25% / \~100 will be made blendable and/or craftable for PXJ (half as WaxPebbles, and half directly as WaxRocks)
* 25%/ \~100 will be distributed via our NFT-reward pools (to extra extra lucky event participants, LP-providers)
* 25% / \~100 will be made allocated our dev.pxj vault (to be used as extra special rewards, for collabs/partners/VIPs/influencers or future dApp rewards)

### WaxPebbles:

Our WaxPebbles are "lite" versions of our WaxRocks running at approximately 9% their power with similar mechanics. 50 WaxRocks were fractured into 10 WaxPebbles each, leaving 500 WaxPebbles to be reassembled back into WaxRocks (or for them to be used as they are).

The WaxPebbles come in the same variety of colors as the WaxRocks, but you'll need 10 of the same one to blend them into its matching WaxRock, and WaxRocks cannot be deconstructed back into WaxPebbles again once combined.&#x20;

* 20% of WaxPebbles will be made available to be crafted for purely PXJ
* 20% of WaxPebbles will be made available to be crafted with PXJ and Single Pixel NFTs
* 40% of WaxPebbles will be added to our NFT Reward pools
* 20% of WaxPebbles will be reserved for our dev.pxj vault



### The hard decisions:

The WaxRocks Council will also gain access to monthly votes towards the control of a 25% share of the creator market earning fees, and a portion of monthly PXJ to allocate, which they can choose to put to use for boosting various aspects of our journey.\
\
These options would all be open for discussion within the council-lounges, however examples for their uses could be:

* Wax airdrop rewards for the Discord Community
* Wax airdrop rewards for certain trait holders
* Wax rewards for promotional contests
* A boost to other selected promotional efforts (ads, guides, streamers)
* Added project liquidity in the LPs
* Added TacoSwap LP reward boosts (optionally in Wax itself, or secondary tokens such as TACO or TLM)
* Added Pixel-NFT-reward-pool rewards (optionally from a select voted project)
* Rewards for special community-acknowledged contributions (or even the council members themselves)
* And what other suggestions may be brought up / approved by the team

The WaxRock council will also have a large influence towards which other projects along the journeys we should be reaching out to, or strengthening our shared bonds with in various possible ways along the journey.
