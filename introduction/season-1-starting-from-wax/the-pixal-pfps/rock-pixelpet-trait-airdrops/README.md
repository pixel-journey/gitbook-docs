# Rock/PixelPet (Trait) Airdrops

Among the Pixal PFPs traits there will be three (3) trait types with a chance to on their own reward the PFP holders with NFT airdrops at a later (and community announced) date. These three are:&#x20;

* WaxRocks
* Pixel Pets
* Certain BG-traits (from photography created by Piga)

The WaxRocks functionality will start out using the ownership of the PFPs with the traits, and the Pixel Pets won't come into function into a later phase of the Journey, still. \


Additionally each of the special PigaPhoto-BG traits will have a chance to both drop their owners a version of those photo-NFTs, and later on have a chance to get airdropped random future PigaPhoto featured collectible NFTs as well! More info on this to come - but for now, can you guess which BGs it could be? 👀😉🔥
