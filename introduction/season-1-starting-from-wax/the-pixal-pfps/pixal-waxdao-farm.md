# Pixal WAXDAO Farm

{% endembed %}

Our first Pixal NFT Staking Farm on WaxDAO started out 18th of March 2024, and distributes 0.25 PXJ/hour for each Pixal staked. The staking is non-custodial, meaning that the Pixal PFPs remain in stakers wallets (and can for example be listed on markets simultaniously with staking).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Our first Pixal farm there was a V1 Farm, which had a 5000 asset staking limit while Pixals were getting minted, and while we prepared for the next PxJourney NFT Farming phase with our Pixel Collectibles.

### New Pixal staking farm coming soon!
