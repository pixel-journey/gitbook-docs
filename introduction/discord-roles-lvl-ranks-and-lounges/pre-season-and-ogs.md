# üßì Pre-Season & OGs

The Season 1 Pre-Season was/has been the first months of lead up till our first drop, where the first early community members joined along on both our Discord and ùïè Social Media channels, and slowly already got a head start on this Journey to come.\
\
In this period we've shared much of the progress and status of how everything went along with the development, and sought out inputs/feedback on various aspects such as our art, and how to further improve various parts of the project, already from the very start.\
\
We've run a series of early ecosystem-giveaways (approximately twice a week), where \~10-20 NFTs from the Wax space were distributed to lucky winners on our Discords event channel.\
\
And the Discords leveling/user Rank system has been initiated, with a few handfuls of users reaching our first private lounges and their perks within.\
\
The most active, dedicated, contributing and lucky members, have in this period further had the opportunity to obtain our early **OG rank** by completing one of the following tasks:

* _`Our levelling event: Reaching level 10 to unlock access to our level-restricted lounge as one of the first 10-35* to claim your OG role`_ <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/805611097229885491.gif?size=44&#x26;quality=lossless" alt=":typingcat:" data-size="line">
* _`Our inviting event: The first ~5-`**`10`**` ``to refer +10 new members to the server with your own generated server invites can also obtain the OG role`_ <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/847587660356255765.gif?size=44&#x26;quality=lossless" alt=":megaphone:" data-size="line">
* _`Content/art contribution event: Up to`` `**`10`**` ``to contribute to the project with Pixel Journey themed graphics or content (emoijs, stickers, gifs, promo-banner-ideas, blogposts or memes), may be lucky to be granted the OG role`_ <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1130748552285528066.webp?size=44&#x26;quality=lossless" alt=":allthethings:" data-size="line">
* _`Collab-finder event: Up to`` `**`10`**` ``to aid/refer to the Pixel Journey in securing new partnerships/collabs (either already pre-launch, or for the future journey), may have a chance of obtaining this OG role as well!`_ <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1132630424129126400.webp?size=44&#x26;quality=lossless" alt=":mafiahat:" data-size="line">
* _`OG-Event-participant bonus reward chance: Top/random ~`**`5-15`**` ``winners of our initial Carl-bot giveaways may also have a chance at a bonus OG-role in the end (if they haven't already obtained it elsewise) .. So make sure to enter all of those!`_ <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/927943797403443200.webp?size=44&#x26;quality=lossless" alt=":BebeGift:" data-size="line"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1130748552285528066.webp?size=44&#x26;quality=lossless" alt=":allthethings:" data-size="line">

These OG-roles were meant to mainly end up being for bragging rights, however they may occasionally be used as special whitelists or as target of bonus airdrops, along the future journey to come as well.
