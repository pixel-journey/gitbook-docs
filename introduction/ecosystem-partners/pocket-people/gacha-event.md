In the Gacha Season 1 event, we have the opportunity to blend our Bronze Coins into various Gacha collectibles.&#x20;

For participants lucky to find 3 of the same one, they can be blended into an Upgraded Gacha Sticker, that aside from looking fancier, also has the opportunity to stake in the WaxDAO Farm for the Pocketverse! ðŸ‘€ðŸ¥³
