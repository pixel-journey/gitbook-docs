# WUFFITap

A Telegram powered WUFFI Tapper app, where you can accumulate "PAWs" by tapping (or by completing various daily \~SoMe quests made available there)

### Recruit:

Feel free to join Wuffi tap via my recruit invite here: ðŸ˜„ðŸ’“

By recruiting users to WUFFI Tap you accumulate achievements, and receive a few PAWs per user who gets started.

You can also find a Leaderboard showing you the position of the one who invited you + any recruits you've made.

### Quests:

On this page you'll find three different category of quests (selected in the top):

* **Special:** On the first page you'll find the daily login tasks, where you can claim up to 6.65M Paw for 10 consecutive days logged in (_**Huuuge?**_), so don't forget to get those daily claims!

Below there are Special Social Quests, such as joining various SoMe platform WUFFI channels, or following $WUF on certain platforms. The special quests here refresh daily, and give a nice amount of PAW of 50-200k per task (= making it VERY GOOD to getted those initial boosts with to get started .. Do this, and upgrade your seasonal boosters before using your daily powerups etc)

* **League:** These are League/Seasonal quests, and don't refresh daily but every season (season 1 is 75.5 days)

These quests are about reaching different heights of PAWs accumulated, and earn you a nice amount of PAW for each step reached as well (**don't forget to claim these!**)

_Tip:_ The first league quest grants you 1k PAW for just doing 1 tap!

* **Recruit quests:** Also seasonal quests, that earn you PAW per number of recruits you've invited to the WUFFI Tap Platform.

### Mine:

Where the manually tapping action happens!

<div data-full-width="false">

</div>

On the middle of the Mine page you'll find a huge WUFFI logo that you can tap, and your energy bar below which keeps you informed of your remaining energy.

**TON Wallet Connect:** In the top left corner you can connect your TON Wallet from the Telegram app to the Wuffi dApp. If you haven't already created a TON wallet, then it'll guide you through creating one!

**Leaderboard:** On the top of the mine page you find the link to accessing the seasons leaderboards.

**Settings:** From the Mine page you can navigate to the apps settings from the burger menu in the top right corner, from where it's possible to turn off the haptic feedback from taps.

### Boosts:

On the Boosts Page you can find "**daily boosts**", which reset every day at 12pm UTC. Here you find:

* Nitro Taps: Boosting your tapping power by 500% for 20 seconds, with no energy cost per tap
* Energy Instant Fill: refills your energy to your limit Each of these can be used 3 times a day for free. (Accumulating a good amount of seasonal boost upgrades without the daily boosts of each day, is most advisable)

PAWs can also be utilized to upgrade your tapping power for the in three different **seasonal lasting boosts:**

* Tapping Power (how much energy you spend and PAW you earn per tap)
* Energy Max Limit (how high your energy can regenerate before maxing out)
* Energy/s generation (how fast you regenerate your energy) When using your PAWs on increasing any of these, you "spend" that PAW, and it no longer counts towards your PAW holdings for that season/leaderboard positioning - so be strategic about when/what to upgrade in which order, and remember to claim your achievements for reaching new big PAW-holdings before spending it all on upgrades.

Each boost starts at 2k PAW, and doubles for each upgrade.

### Tapbot:

For 10k PAW you can enable a TapBot that auto-farms 1 PAW/s for you for 6 hours (generating you 21600 PAW per 6 hours)

The level 1 tapbot only requires PAW, and is most advised to keep running (and keeping 10k PAW available for restarting once runs out)

The PAW accumulated by the TapBot needs to be claimed from it, (so that may also be something worth keeping in mind, if just a few PAW short for an upgrade or so)
