# Pawtner Utility Integrations

## Pixel Journey

Stake WUF alongside PXJ, and explore DeFi on the Wax blockchain with the Pixel Journey!

We offer attractive APR rewards with PXJ (and on Alcor WUF) rewards on our MEAL and Alcor Farms for our shared pools, ensuring they're always a sweet and competitive pool to keep the tokens working in.

Our branch of the WUF DeFi brought in over $500k in volumes of our pair in the first few months after the WUF launch on the Wax blockchain, where it on key-activity dates had volume fee APR rewards as high as +4000% APR for the days of massive price spiking activity.

Find our pairs on [Alcor Exchange ](https://alcor.exchange/analytics/pools/1657)and [TacoSwap](https://swap.tacocrypto.io/meal?search=wuf).
