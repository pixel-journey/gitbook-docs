WUFFI was launched in Q1 2024 as a major memecoin on the Wax blockchain, supported by the Wax.io team, with brand new CloudWallet Bridges connecting the Wax Blockchain with Solana, and the memecoin mania that have taken a fast hold in the Solana DeFi sector. As well as in the following months to release bridges between BASE and .. Soon more ecosystems to come! ðŸ‘€

WUFFI Pawtnered up with +100 projects from the Wax and Solana ecosystems, where we've been lucky to be one of them as well!

## WUFFI Release Celebrations

### Our first Pixal Holder WUFFI Airdrop

On the day of WUFFI release we airdropped 1B WUF across all Pixal holders per PFP held, which resulted in 185k WUFFI/Pixal held for holders, and a great introduction of the new tokens availability on the Wax blockchain. For this we dedicated our own pixeljourney accounts WUF-claims from the initial Wax snapshots.

Simultaneously we airdropped 1.5M PXJ across holders in the same swoop, incentivizing to pair up their airdrops in our new PXJ/WUF DeFi to continue building up TVL between our two token economies, and to start accumulating Farm/LP rewards from those pairs from the waves of volume brought to Wax DeFi.



### PXJ / WUF liquidity pool incentives

From day 1 of the WUF we've offered a few different Liquidity Pool Incentives on Alcor and TacoSwap, offering amongst the best LP-pairs for WUFFI on the Wax Blockchain for these few first months of WUFFI DeFi. With Farm/MEAL APR Rewards starting at high as 8000% APR, and still going strong at nearly 200% APR (at time of writing)!

Over 10M of our pixeljourney PXJ have been added towards their LP Rewards, and their pools will periodically be balanced towards being competitive with our WAX/LSW/USDT and many other pairs.

## Our Pawtner Allocations

In return as part of our Pawtner role with WUFFI, we've gotten some WUF to distribute towards the Pixel Journey community as well ðŸ¥³ In 3 allocations of 1.666B WUFFI, distributed \~every 2 months, for the first half year post WUFFI launch. [The first allocation we received May 10 2024](https://waxblock.io/transaction/530763dabb69a8d14d756c5b23871735d1bcfb02dd7de9745fdca67ab063a2f0)

These allocations have been discussed how to best put to use within the community, and after a series of interesting discussions and votes, we've ended up on the following:

* 20% of our allocation dedicated to our NFT/PFP holders via pixals.pxj from where it's distributed towards our Pixal Holders Trait rewards (as part of our end-of-month snapshots)
* 70% of our allocation is distributed to our DeFi Journey participants via our main LP pairs (on Alcor; PXJ/WAX, PXJ/USDT, PXJ/LSW)
* 10% of our allocation dedicated to dao.pxj from where the Council will decide on what to use it (on a still future date/vote/to be decided usage)

As we already dedicated 1B WUF to our PXJ/WUF pair & 1B WUF to Pixal Holders from our own initial airdrops, then it was decided that pairs WUF rewards to be down-prioritized to both be able to boost the PXJ side of that pairs' farm rewards more instead, which we hope will invite more WUFFI-joiners towards our PXJ DeFi economy and widely available LP pairs.&#x20;

And to be able to reward the already actively engaged Pixel Journey DeFi users participating in our core Alcor pairs of WAX, USDT and LSW with more WUFFI rewards along the way that they too can choose to continue to building up TVL between our shared PXJ/WUF pair with.



### Pixal Trait Holder Airdrops for May/June '24:

With the 20% of WUFFI allocated towards Pixal NFT holder rewards, it was decided within the community to target only specific random trait holders (in the style of our usual Trait Rewards), instead of airdropping much smaller quantities of WUF across all holders per Pixal held.

\~10% of the allocation here was airdropped over two End-of-Month Airdrops:

*   May Trait Holder WUFFI airdrops:

    The randomly picked traits ended up being:

    * Lightning Elemental (PixelPet) w/ 172 eligible for 245.5k WUFFI each
    * Rusty (Hats and Hair) w/ 28 eligible for 1.5M WUFFI each
    * Pocket Head Band Red (Hats and Hair) w/ 208 eligible for 203k WUFFI each
    * Stormy Sky (Background) w/ 44 eligible for 950K WUF each
* June Trait Holder WUFFI airdrops:\

  * Vantablack (Head), with [130 eligible Pixals each receiving: 159k WUF](https://waxblock.io/transaction/550a3c99583b656aaa8efbebc507e5d0f16ebe15babbeb6ddb106082d8231939)
  * Tin (Head), with [443 eligible Pixals each receiving: 46.7k WUF](https://waxblock.io/transaction/4bc019613677ed883ee0e40e29947cceca3724f5a6dbbac0f714913177338513)
  * Orange (Eyes), with [202 eligible Pixals each receiving: 102.5k WUF](https://waxblock.io/transaction/4def9ea1e9568a1067515be9a58a59089cb05a0cf5de3ce8ed5ce67c2dfe3f86)
  * Blue (Mouth), with [306 eligible Pixals each receiving: 67.7k WUF](https://waxblock.io/transaction/aec69907910b0d2d2d1bb717aff8435bde59a96fd5c29489da3b34f37ccc7da7)
  * Basic Cyan (Body), with 341 eligible Pixals each receiving: 60.8k WUF

  * Zombie Green (Eyes), with 79 eligible Pixals each receiving: 262.2k WUF

Aside from the WUF airdropped for these Trait Holder snapshots, we also airdropped nice amounts of CHAD, and of course our PXJ as always.



### Alcor PXJ/WUF Spot Market:

We've opened a PXJ/WUF Spot Market on Alcor where Spot Market features can be utilized between our token and DeFi economies. Making it the 3rd WUFFI Spot Market on the Alcor Exchange! And it permits trading PXJ<>WUF entirely without fees!&#x20;

### Pixal Drop WUFFI purchase option:

For our OG Pixal Drop we enabled the option to use WUFFI as a payment option for the last \~week of our Pixal sale for the last 10% of our PFP supply alongside another few token options such as LSW and USDT. From there we committed to burn 10% of WUFFI spent.

10 Pixals were bought with the WUFFI payment option, leading to this 2.1m WUF burn:

### PXJ Token Coin redeemables NFTs for WUFFI:

As part of our efforts towards building a more stable DeFi, and opening our PXJ-economy doors to new fronts, we've enabled a number of additional ecosystem tokens aside from PXJ to redeem PXJ Token Coin Redeemables at \~weekly balanced prices.

{% embed url="https://neftyblocks.com/collection/pixeljourney/drops/208693" %}
[https://neftyblocks.com/collection/pixeljourney/drops/208693](https://neftyblocks.com/collection/pixeljourney/drops/208693)
{% endembed %}

The PXJ rate of the redeemables offer an average of 10250 PXJ per coin, and can be acquired either with PXJ itself or the available ecosystem token options enabled at a 5-15% higher rate.

The PXJ Token Coin redeemables unpack to an average of 10250 PXJ again, with outcomes ranging from 2000 PXJ to 100k PXJ, meaning that even while paying the 5-15% premium there can be chances to "get lucky".

Occasionally there may be extraordinary events where rates will be near equal or discounted rates, so make sure to keep up on socials!

25% of WUFFI spent towards our PXJ Token Coin redeemable drops is burned, and the remaining 75% is added towards our PXJ/WUF positions towards further building up our interlaced DeFi economy.
