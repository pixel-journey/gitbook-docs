# WaxDAO NFT Farms

On WaxDAO there are 2 different versions of NFT Farms, with a few different setting options.

Farms can either be custodial (meaning the staked assets are transferred to the WaxDAO wallet for the duration of the staking), or non-custodial farms (meaning the staked NFT assets remain in your wallet).



An example of a Version 1 Farm can be our initial pixal staking farm here below:

Farms are created with different Farm Types to cover/target different types of scopes of the collection:

* Entire collection
* Entire Schema
* Schemas with Exclusions (For V1 Farms)
* Specific Templates
* Specific Attributes (For V2 Farms)

For V1 Farms it's possible to edit the staking weight/earnings after Farm creation, and add in additional collections, or templates to become stakable in the Farm.
