## Why might WaxDAO be important for you as a collector?

WaxDAO offers a series of tools to add utility for various projects, but as a user you do in some cases need to actively participate in the features released for NFT-collections via WaxDAO!

NFT (Staking) Farms require NFTs to be staked/added to take part in their reward distribution from there, and the rewards need to be claimed. In this section of our Pixel-docs we'll take a closer look at how all that is done.
