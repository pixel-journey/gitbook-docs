# Listing single NFTs on AH

From your Atomichub Inventory you can choose which of your collected NFTs to put on sale across the Wax Network marketplaces with just a few clicks! Start out by finding your desired NFT to list, and clicking the "List on Market" button in the bottom.

This opens the "Create Listing" interface from where you can see price data(, you can click the "Show more" expand link to get a view at sales history graphs), you can select a Listing Price in either WAX (or WAX/USD), and get details about the total listing fees (that are subtracted from your profits in case the listing sells)

By clicking the boxes in the "Price Data" section you can auto-fill those values into the listing price to quickly match the lowest matching listing or suggested price.
