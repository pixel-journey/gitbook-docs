With the AH Creators tools you can:

* Create new collections on the Wax Blockchain
* Configure/edit collection details (such as name, description, royalty fees, logo/banners, and more)
* Create new schemas (categories) within your collections
* Create new templates (NFT series) within your schemas
* Mint new NFTs (either with a template), or as separate assets (without a template they all become 1/1s). The minted NFTs can be received by the owner or a chosen receiving wallet.
* Claim royalty fees
* Lock max supply of templates (if a higher maximum limit had been defined previously)
* Create AH Market Filters (to include the opportunity for filtering assets per select attributes)
* Create a Collectors Page (using the editor)
* Authorize additional Wax accounts to manage your collections (except claiming royalties, which can only be done by the collection owner)
