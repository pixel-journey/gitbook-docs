# Creating Categories(Schemas) on AH

Navigate to your collections creator page, and find the "Categories" Tab in the Creator Tools.

From there click the first icon from the left "Create Category ( + )"

Here the first thing you need is to name your category. Choosing an easily classifiable Category Name can be a good idea, pick something descriptive of the NFTs/templates of NFTs you're intending to create within the Category.



Categories come with 3 default Attributes:

* name
* img
* video

and from there you have the option to add in any custom Attributes you'd like to add in.

Beware that these are **immutable** attributes, and cannot be edited/changed in Names or Types after the Category has been created.

These attributes will then be default/optional for each of the NFTs created within it, and can be a useful way to allow users to Filter for the desired assets on secondary markets, or to add in special attribute related functionality within their collection.



Attributes of NFTs are **only** defined in their Categories, and will be present on all templates/NFTs created within it.

A category is required for creating a NFT  Template, which we look into on the next page here.
