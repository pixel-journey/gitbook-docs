All that is needed is filling out the metadata/uploading a logo, and you're set to go.

* Upload a logo/img to IPFS directly via Atomichub
* Fill out the necessary Collection Details ("Collection Name" cannot be edited later, so choose it carefully!)
* Optionally fill out SoMe/Company Details (can also be done later, post collection creation)
* Optionally add more authorized accounts to have access to managing the collection
* Click "Save" and your Collection comes up live shortly after!
