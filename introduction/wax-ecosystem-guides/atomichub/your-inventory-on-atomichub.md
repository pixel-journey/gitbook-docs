From this menu you can also importantly navigate directly to your listings, or to claim your accumulated $WOMBAT rewards from having traded on Atomichub. Once opened you get an overview of the NFTs held by the logged in Wax account, as well as a total inventory estimated value (calculated from past sales for each NFT/NFT series)

With the controls for multi-selections using the tick-boxes, or each individual NFTs options, you can choose to transfer, initiate new trades, [create new Gift URL links](creating-url-gift-claim-links.md), [burn](burning-nfts-on-ah.md)/back the NFTs with Tokens, or to create bundle listings.
