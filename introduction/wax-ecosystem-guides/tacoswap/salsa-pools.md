# SALSA Pools

SALSA Pools are $TACO token staking pools, where TACO can be earned to earn other Ecosystem Tokens. In return the top5 most staked SALSA pools are weekly granted TACO token Rewards to their WAX MEAL pair, creating a bigger incentive for token creators/projects to incentivize bigger TACO stakes towards their SALSA pairs.
