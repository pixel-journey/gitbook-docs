TacoSwap MEAL Rewards are Liquidity Pool reward pools for various created token pairs on the TacoSwap DEX.&#x20;

Only Token Contract creators/owners can create MEAL rewards with their tokens as token rewards, for the pools where their token is paired. It's also possible to add WAXP rewards, but no other tokens can be added in as MEAL rewards, and only by the token creators themselves.

Occasionally there's a few ways to win extraordinary TACO token rewards for MEAL pools as well, either via TACOG Governance votes, or via being a top staked SALSA pool.
