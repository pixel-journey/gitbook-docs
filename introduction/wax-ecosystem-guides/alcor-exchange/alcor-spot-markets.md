# Alcor Spot Markets

On Alcor Exchange you can find Spot Markets for all/most the most popular tokens in Wax Defi.

Compared to the instant Swap-options, that simply makes the trade at the pool rates the token is paired up with in LP-DeFi; then Spot Markets offer you the opportunity to make buy/sell orders to prepare liquidity at certain defined price rates. This can be useful for preparing to catch a dip, or to sell tokens at a desired higher rate.

{% hint style="info" %}
Where many LP Swaps take at minimum 0.05-1% in fees from Swaps, most Alcor Spot Markets are feeless for makers/takers of orders on them.\
\
A  few Spot Markets for pairs such as: WUF, TLM, VOID and a few others have Spot Order fees of 0.2%.
