# Trouble Accessing a dApp on WAX Blockchain

To address this, follow the troubleshooting steps below:

1. Ensure the URL is accurate and you're visiting the right site.
2. Consider using a different browser or try accessing the site in incognito/private mode.
3. Clear your browser cache.
4. Execute a hard refresh on the page: **For PC:** Press CTRL + F5. | **For Mac:** Hold down Command + Shift + R.
5. If still unresolved, attempt a forced log out by visiting: [https://mycloudwallet.com/logout](https://mycloudwallet.com/logout). Afterwards, sign back in.
6. If you're using an iOS device, disable cross-site tracking protection. In Safari:
   * Click on Safari, then choose Settings (or Preferences for older versions of macOS).
   * Navigate to the Privacy tab.
   * Uncheck the box "Prevent cross-site tracking" to disable it.

If the issues persist, please reach out for help on Discord.
