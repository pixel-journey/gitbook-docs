# Unstaking for WAX Blockchain Resources

**To unstake your WAXP:**

1. Visit the WAX Block Explorer at: [https://waxblock.io/wallet/resources/unstake](https://waxblock.io/wallet/resources/unstake).
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to successfully unstake your WAXP.

Please be aware of the following points related to unstaking:

* After unstaking, it takes approximately 72 hours for your staked WAXP to be returned to your account.
* If you're already awaiting a refund from a previous unstaking and decide to unstake additional tokens, the 72-hour refund timer will restart.
* Should you have tokens being refunded and decide to stake more tokens, the system will prioritize re-staking from your refunding supply first.

**Always keep these details in mind to ensure you manage your WAXP effectively and avoid any unintended delays.**&#x20;
