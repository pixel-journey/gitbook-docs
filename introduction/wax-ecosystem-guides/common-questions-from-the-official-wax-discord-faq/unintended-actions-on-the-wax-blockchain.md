# Unintended Actions on the WAX Blockchain

Due to the decentralized nature of the WAX blockchain, there are limitations to what support can assist with:

* We **cannot** reverse transactions.
* We **cannot** move assets in or out of your wallet.
* We **cannot** ban, block, or erase any wallet addresses on the blockchain.
* We **cannot** disclose non-public details about any account.
* We **cannot** make changes or modifications to wallets/accounts.

Given these constraints, it's crucial to review and verify every transaction before confirming. Should you make an inadvertent transaction, support won't be in a position to rectify it. Always proceed with caution.
