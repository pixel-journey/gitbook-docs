# Fluctuations in Available CPU on WAX Blockchain

The availability of CPU is directly influenced by the overall activity on the blockchain. When there's an uptick in blockchain operations, the collective CPU becomes more scarce, leading to a reduction in the amount of CPU you receive for each staked WAXP. To gain insights into the CPU consumption of specific transactions, you can utilize one of the blockchain explorers previously mentioned. For a deeper understanding of this mechanism and its implications, consider reading:
