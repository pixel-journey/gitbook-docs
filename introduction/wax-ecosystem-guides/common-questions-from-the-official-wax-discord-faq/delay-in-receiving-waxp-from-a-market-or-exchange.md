# Delay in Receiving WAXP from a Market or Exchange

In such cases, it's best to contact the support team of the specific exchange or market where you made the transaction. Regrettably, **WAX does not possess the capability to access their systems**, and therefore cannot oversee or assist with your transaction directly.
