  available resources on my WAX account?

# WAX Account Activity

For My Cloud Wallet Users: Visit the My Cloud Wallet Dashboard at: https://mycloudwallet.com/dashboard Click on "Activity" found right below your balance.

For ALL Users: To see your account's transaction history, enter your wallet name or address into a block explorer. Our top recommendation is: https://waxblock.io/.

Always remember to use legitimate and trusted sources when retrieving your account data. (edited)
