# Two-Factor Authentication

If you can't access your 2FA codes, refer to the 2FA recovery code provided to you when you initially set up 2FA on the WAX Cloud Wallet. This recovery code is an 8-10 character alpha-numeric string. To regain access, simply input this recovery code into the standard 2FA entry field when logging into your account. Please remember that the recovery code is case-sensitive. **The Support Team is unable to manually remove 2FA from Cloud Wallets.**&#x20;
