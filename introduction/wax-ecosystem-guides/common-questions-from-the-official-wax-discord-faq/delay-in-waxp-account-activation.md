# Delay in WAXP Account Activation

**First of all, logout and then login again: if your account has received your WAXP, this action will set permissions and finish the account creation.** If that doesn't work, kindly contact our support team in the ‚Å†üó®‚îÉget-help channel on the main Wax.io Discord for assistance. To expedite the process, please have the following details ready:

* The transaction link for the payment.
* A screenshot showcasing the account activation screen, especially the memo.
* For activations via Coinbase: also include the Order #.

Once we've reviewed the information, we'll guide you further. It's crucial not to resend your payment multiple times.
