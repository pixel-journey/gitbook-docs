# How to burn NFTs on Neftyblocks

{% hint style="danger" %}
**BEWARE: Burning of NFTs is permanent, and irreversible.**

Most services/mechanics that burn NFTs, do it automatically as part of their blending/consumption contract, so it is very rare you might need to directly burn a NFT from your inventory.

The creator for the NFTs minted is restored the RAM cost they paid when minting the NFT, once it is burned. However that is the creator, and not **you** as a holder for burning it. So burning NFTs don't clear up your own Wax accounts RAM, unless you were the one to create those NFTs.



**If you don't have a specific/clear reason to burn a NFT; it's nearly never advised to do so.**
{% endhint %}

To Burn mechanic is accessed from the [profile/inventory on Neftyblocks](your-inventory-on-neftyblocks.md).&#x20;



From there you click on the three-dot-dropdown menu on the top of your desired NFT, pick the "Burn NFT" option and complete the prompted transaction.

**`ONLY DO THIS IF YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SURE`**
