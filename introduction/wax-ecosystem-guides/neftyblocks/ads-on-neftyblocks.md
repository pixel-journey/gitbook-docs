>
> On NeftyBlocks you don't buy banners, you burn $NEFTY to book banners. The amount of $NEFTY that you must burn to get a banner is shown in the INFO dialog on the banners management page. There's a unitarian amount of $NEFTY required for banners with a duration of fewer than 12 hours, a dozen price which is between 12 and 24 hours, and a bulk price for banners lasting 24 hours or more (up to 5 days). Collections reaching a staking level have a discount. For further reading, you can go to the banners section of the [FAQ](https://neftyblocks.com/faq?list=banners#what-are-the-prices-for-banners)
