As seen from the table here above, most Neftyblocks features are unlocked by default by all tiers.\
These are covered in our next pages, instead here we'll focus on where the tiers differ and the perks to unlock by staking NEFTY to Collections on NB.

### Discounted promotional banners:

* Level 1 get a 5% discount
* Level 2 get a 15% discount
* Level 3 a 35% discount

Learn all about banners in [Ads on Neftyblocks](ads-on-neftyblocks.md)

### Feature on Nefty Royal

On the Nefty Royals page on NB users can explore collections staking NEFTY. The higher the NEFTY stake of the collection, the higher the position of the collection on the Nefty Royal list.

Explore it yourself here below:

### Free Banners when no banners are booked

A fantastic perk at Level 3 collection staking is the opportunity to add a banner into the ads rotation for when no banners have otherwise been booked, and can be well worth the NEFTY staking for collections.

Free banners are limited to being able to link to within the Collections page on Neftyblocks, but can be customized to direct directly to /blends, or drops, for the collection as well.

### Priority Support

Level 3 staking also unlocks priority support with the Neftyblocks team on their Discord. After reaching Level 3 a private/project dedicated support channel can be requested on their server to access the Priority Support.

There you can find support for everything from basic UI support of the Neftyblocks platform, to inquiring about custom contract creation development, or .
