# PFPWizard

Straight from the front page of PFPWizard you can keep track of the latest, trending or ongoing PFP sales for collections on Wax that've been listed there. Not all collections are available from PFPWizard by default, and does require project owners to send a listing request (if eligible as a PFP type project)
