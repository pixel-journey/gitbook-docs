# OG Wizzy Breeding

## Breeding Basics

Occasionally Breeding Seasonal events happen for the OG Wizzys in which periods holders can pair up their OG Wizzys, (add in a Wizzy child minting fee), and receive a Wizzy Child NFT that has a chance to inherit traits from its' parents!

Unlike OG Wizzys, then Wizzy Children **do not grant Magic Power,** nor can be used in themselves for future breeding yet. (Wen grand children!? Buccia hinted at maybe somewen)

In the end of each Breeding Season a series of Leaderboard rewards are distributed towards specifically event-announced rewards to specific Rarity Ranks reached by WIzzys.



{% hint style="info" %}
Keep in mind that Rarity Ranks stem from the Rarity Scores of each NFT for each schema/template, and are subject to influence/manipulation by burning NFTs.

Therefore ranks can fluctuate slightly post minting (even if the series have been fully minted already), and this can be a key to achieving certain specific Rarity Ranks.

It is not 'illegal' to burn Wizzy Children to try and influence the Rarity Traits of other children.

### Season 1 - Deer Wizzy (WaxDeer)

In the first season of Wizzy breeding, the WaxDeer project was featured in a series of special Deer Wizzy children exclusive traits.&#x20;

Each Deer Wizzy was created by breeding two OG Wizzys, and paying a 0.1 ANTLER (or a 50k WUF) fee. The ANTLER fees collected here was distributed across the Deer Wizzy leaderboards in the end of the breeding period.

```
0.1 ANTLERS (WAX Deer main token) or 50,000 WUF
ANTLERS are added to the main prize pool, 50% of WUF is also added while 50% of WUF is burned
```

From the PFPWiz Discord we had the following special deer traits:

```dot
# Deer Wizzy - New traits odds

The basic odds without counting the Gem boosters:
• Background: jungle (10%)
• Body: deer fur (50%)
• Eyes: wild deer (10%)
• Hair: shag deer cut (10%)
• Clothing: deer jersey (10%)
• Adornment: WDJC necklace (10%)
• Headwear: deer antlers (50%)
• Mouth: deer snout (10%)
• Special: pet deer (2%)
• Hand: WDJC collectible (0.3%)
```

\
After each breeding/Deer Wizzy mint, there was a chance for Instant Rewards:

```markup
# New Collaboration Traits and Rewards:
2 traits with 50% odds: 0.05 ANTLERS
6 traits with 10% odds: 0.2 ANTLERS
1 trait with 2% odds: 1.25 ANTLERS
1 trait with 0.3% odds: 1 Wax Deer NFT
```

These arrived immediately after mint, and could help breeders in continue breeding. In average for Season 1 almost half of ANTLER used in breeding was returned via Instant Rewards.
