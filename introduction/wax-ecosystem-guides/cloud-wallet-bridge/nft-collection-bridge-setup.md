# NFT Collection Bridge Setup

First step is selecting the blockchains you want to send from -> to, and selecting a collection that your wallet owns. Once this is done, you are prompted with a TX to sign to start the bridging process.

Once the bridging setup for the collection has processed, it becomes claimable on the next tab "Claim Collection" where a TX needs to be signed from the wallet of the blockchain where the collection becomes minted.

Once this is completed, the NFT Bridge becomes available for asset owners of the bridged collection in both directions via the MyCloudWallet Bridge.
