# PXJ WRITERS PROGRAM

The PXJ Writers Program unlocks via our Discord from reaching server level 20 there (accomplishable within a few weeks of server activity without boosts, or much quicker with a few assets).

The incentive is simple:

* Write Guides -> Submit them for Community Content Review in our Writers Lounge
* Once approved by the community -> the guides are integrated into/updated to our PxJourney Docs here
* Once integrated/updated -> a proposal is presented to the WaxRocks Council/PixelDAO to reward the submitter (either via standard amounts, or extraordinarily to match the contribution)



### Standard PXJ Writers Reward Estimates:

* Write/share/submit an original thread about the PixelJourney for SoMe (-> \~5000 PXJ reward)
* Write/share/submit an article covering one of the many facets of the Pixel Journey (-> \~25000-50000 PXJ reward)
* Write/update(/submit) a PxJourney Docs page on our site here (-> \~5000-15000 PXJ reward)
* Write/share/submit a chapter of Pixel Journey lore (-> up to \~25000 PXJ reward)
* Link to our Pixel Journey Docs/guides here from your publications on Wax/ecosystem releases (-> \~500 PXJ per link)
* Write/share/submit other ecosystem related guides, containing mentions or links to the Pixel Journey. Such as detailing other ecosystem projects (-> up to 10000 PXJ reward)
* 'Bugfix/update' (a lot) in past content (-> possibly a smaller PXJ reward)



Rewards may vary, and can also end up being split between multiple contributors.
