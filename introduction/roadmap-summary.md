# üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap (summary)

1. PXJ Token Launch: We'll kick things off by launching our PXJ token on the Wax network, initiate liquidity pools with various token pairs across the ecosystem from Alcor and TacoSwap.
2. PXJ Liquidity Pool Rewards: 20(-25)% of our Season 1 PXJ token allocation will be added to LP and staking rewards across Alcor, TacoSwap and Pepperstake.
3. Partnerships and Community Growth: Months will be dedicated to forming partnerships, organizing events, and expanding our community.
4. PFP Collection: Our collection of 10000 Profile Pictures (PFP) in the beginning of 2024, named Pixals will open up new optional paths to be taken in our Pixel Journey/economy.
5. Pixel Recycling: We'll allow burning up to 80% of the PFPs to release their pixels via PixelPacks, which will be recycled into other collectibles using the Neftyblocks blends and NFThive crafts.
6. Pixel Upgrading and Combining: Through blending contracts, we'll enable the upgrading of single pixels and combining them to create more advanced collectibles, or higher upgraded versions of other PJ assets.
7. Airdrop and Collectibles: We'll airdrop rocks and pets based on random traits from the PFP drop sales. Other Pixel blenders and collectors will also have the opportunity to obtain them via Pixel crafting.
8. Collectibles Staking: We'll create staking mechanisms for our collectibles to produce our PXJ token, up to certain shares of the \~20% Season 1 PXJ allocation dedicated towards NFT rewards (subject to voting by the WaxRocks/PixelDAO)
9. WaxRocks Council: We'll establish our Council, an influential advisory community board consisting of a up to a few hundred potential users. They will participate in voting on community decisions.
10. Next Drop/Blending Event: By the end of season 1, we'll conduct a drop or blending event featuring a decorative collectible that requires a PFP, individual pixels, and a third ingredient purchasable with our PXJ token.
11. dApp Utility and Upgrade: In the spring-summer of '25 we'll reveal a planned dApp utility and an upgrade opportunity for the first season of assets, which will bind the entire project together and pave the way for future expansion.
12. Season 2 and dApp Expansion: We'll kick off Season 2 of our PFPs with new art traits in mid '25, scheduled for our 2 year anniversary, while preparing to reveal our further plans for the routes through the Polygon/Ethereum ecosystems.

Our approach to achieving these milestones is through careful project design at every step and layer, as well as thorough planning and active balancing of the projects burn/faucet mechanics to ensure we can maintain stability and sustainability.

We believe that by working together, we can overcome any challenges and contribute to a healthier Web3 scene. Education is crucial to absolutely everybody entering into this Wax/crypto space, so let's try help everybody starting on this shared journey with all the knowledge and support that we can. And collectively make collecting JPEGs, NFTs and crypto a little greater again! üõ∏
